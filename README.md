### Hi, I'm Aria 👋

- 🚀 I've always been very interested and curious about how technology can solve problems in the real world.
- 🤖 I really like a lot of technology, but right now I'm focusing on Android Development.
- 🌱 After finding my interest as an android developer, I decided to study a lot and I taught myself all about Android development and Kotlin.
- 🎯 My goal now is to be able to build technology that benefits everyone.
- 📫 Feel free for contact me or want to invite me to collaborate.
